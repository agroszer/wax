Installing Wax:

Simply grab the 'wax' directory and put it in your Python's lib/site-packages
directory, or any other directory in sys.path.  (Windows users: look for
c:\Python24\lib\site-packages, etc, depending on your Python version.)

Due to recurring problems with distutils, an installation script is
currently not available.
